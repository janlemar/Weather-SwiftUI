# Weather-SwiftUI

[Completed as of 1.16.25]
A modern weather interface built using SwiftUI, as my initial starting project. It is designed to showcase a clean layout, reusable components, and a hierarchy featuring stacks. The app displays weather information and multi-day forecast using SF symbols and gradient backgrounds, mimicking an iOS interface.
